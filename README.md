# Dice-roll-simulator
Its a python project based on Dice rolling 
Dice, singular die, small objects (polyhedrons) used as implements for gambling and the playing of
social games. The most common form of die is the cube, with each side marked with from one to six
small dots (spots). The spots are arranged in conventional patterns and placed so that spots on
opposite sides always add up to seven: one and six, two and five, three and four. There are,
however, many dice with differing arrangements of spots or other face designs, such as poker
dice and crown and anchor dice, and many other shapes of dice with 4, 5, 7, 8, 10, 12, 16, and 20 or
more sides. Dice are generally used to generate a random outcome (most often a number or a
combination of numbers) in which the physical design and quantity of the dice thrown determine the
mathematical probabilities.
